  - [**Phptrace**](https://github.com/Qihoo360/phptrace)
  - [**QConf**](https://github.com/Qihoo360/QConf)

# üìö Projects
- **Open Source Projects**
  - [**Altas**](https://github.com/Qihoo360/Atlas)
  - [**Phptrace**](https://github.com/Qihoo360/phptrace)
  - [**QConf**](https://github.com/Qihoo360/QConf)
  - [**Flame-Code-VLM**](https://github.com/Flame-Code-VLM/Flame-Code-VLM)
- **Consumer Applications**
    - **BuDingAI**: By integrating data learned through DeepSeek, searching the entire network, and collecting Beike‚Äôs data, and using powerful reasoning abilities to replace the human brain for thinking and analysis, and based on this, helping users converge and analyze their needs step by step, recommending suitable brokers to form a complete closed loop.
    - **Sheniu(AIGC Home Decoration Design Tool)**: Based on a self-developed large-scale model, we have constructed a controllable mapping model for decoration scenarios, which realizes various mapping functions such as real shooting mapping, layout mapping, and reference mapping. It has been launched in more than 50 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, serving over 3 million users and more than 80 million mapping images.
    - **3D Loushu**: Through 3D modeling and information restructuring, it provides a 720 ¬∞ panoramic and virtual view display method (location, bird's-eye view, interior view, building) for surrounding supporting facilities, community environment, infrastructure and other content that users are concerned about, breaking the boundaries of viewing space and allowing customers to view the property without leaving their homes, better showcasing the value of the property. 3D reconstruction of the real estate/community, combined with LBS data for physical simulation (lighting, noise, POI), in order to improve user product experience, help users accelerate online screening efficiency, and enhance service providers' understanding of the real estate. Based on the data from Beike Real Estate Dictionary, data-driven 3D reconstruction has been carried out for the real world, achieving large-scale automatic semantic generation of 3D scenes, greatly reducing production barriers, and changing the industry's current situation of relying heavily on manual restoration of large scenes in digital twins and related products.
- **Platform Applications**
    - **Codelink(LLM Code Generation Tool)**: Covering 90% of Beike's R&D personnel, generating over 4 million lines of code, with approximately 20% of Beike's total code generated by Codelink in the past year.
    - **Management Cockpit**: Focusing on the company's inconsistent data construction, numerous exports of data products and management reports, and high data review costs, we have completed the construction and promotion of the group's mainstream data products and platform cockpit, covering multiple functions of the platform and platform ecological personnel such as store owners.
    - **ChatBI(Conversational Data Analysis Tool)**: Using conversational interaction to understand user intent, it can flexibly process, organize, analyze, and present data; And utilizing big data mining and insight technology to assist analysis, helping users better understand and utilize data, and improving the operational decision-making efficiency of managers, BI analysts and other functional personnel. Currently, it covers more than 500 group users.
